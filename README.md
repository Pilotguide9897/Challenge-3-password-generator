# PassGenie - Password Generator

## Description
This application generates a random password based on the user's specifications and is useful for those who are looking to quickly and easily generate a secure password for use on one of their various accounts. The password length must contain between 8 and 128 characters and the user can choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 

The generator works by using several functions to generate random characters of different types (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) based on the user's selections. Once the character types are selected, the generator generates a password of the specified length by iterating over the selected character types and calling the relevant character generation functions. Finally, the generated password is trimmed to the desired length and displayed to the user in the password input field.

## Installation
No installation is required to use this application, however, those who wish to use it may follow the deployment link in the git repo or may clone the repo and open the index.html file in the browser using the files cloned to their local system.

## Usage
To use this application, click on the generate password button on the browser page. This will display a prompt where you may then input the number of characters that are desired in the password. From here, a series of prompts appear that either allow the user to click "confirm" to specify that they want to include that type of character in the generated password, or click "cancel" to confirm that they do not. Once this is achieved, a password of the desired length and including the specified character types will be typed in the box provided. You may then highlight and copy the password to be pasted wherever it is needed!
